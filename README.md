## Computing Abductive Explanations 
*Luciano Caroprese, Ester Zumpano, Bart Bogaerts*

This repository contains what is needed to run the experiments related to *Examples 3* and *Example 4* reported in the paper and the full proof of Theorem 2.  
It contains the following files: 

- *dlv.mingw-odbc.exe*  
  The DLV system ([http://www.dlvsystem.com/](http://www.dlvsystem.com/)).   
- *Example_3.txt*, *Example_4.txt*, *Example_5.txt*  
  Source files containing the rewritings.
- *runNoFilter_Example_3.bat*, *runNoFilter_Example_4.bat*, *runNoFilter_Example_5.bat*  
  Batch files allowing to run the experiments on Windows systems and compute the stable models of the rewritings.
- *run_Example_3.bat*, *run_Example_4.bat*, *run_Example_5.bat*  
  Batch files allowing to run the experiments on Windows systems and compute the abductive explanations.
- *resultNoFilter_Example_3.txt*, *resultNoFilter_Example_4.txt*, *resultNoFilter_Example_5.txt*  
  The stable models of the rewritings.
- *result_Example_3.txt*, *result_Example_4.txt*, *result_Example_5.txt*   
  The abductive explanations.
- *Appendix.pdf*
